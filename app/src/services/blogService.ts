  "50-prompt-benchmark": `## Setup

We ran 50 diverse prompts through Nadir's binary classifier with these settings:

- **Benchmark model:** Claude Sonnet 4 ($3/1M input, $15/1M output)
- **Available models:** Claude Sonnet, Claude Haiku, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Analyzer:** Binary classifier (DistilBERT-based)

The prompts were split into three categories: 17 simple, 17 medium, 16 complex.

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Routing accuracy | 96% (48/50 correct) |
| Average latency | 107ms per classification |
| Overall savings | 38% |

### Per-tier breakdown

**Simple prompts (17/17 correct):** All routed to Gemini Flash. 97% savings vs benchmark.

Examples: "What is Python?", "Convert 72F to Celsius", "Is 7 a prime number?"

**Medium prompts (17/17 correct):** Routed to Gemini Flash. 97% savings.

Examples: "Write a Python palindrome checker", "Explain JWT auth step by step", "Write a SQL query for second highest salary"

**Complex prompts (14/16 correct):** 14 stayed on Sonnet, 2 were mis-routed to Flash. Complex prompts stay on the premium model by design, but Context Optimize still compacts their input tokens (minifying JSON, deduplicating tool schemas, normalizing whitespace) before sending to the provider. That's where the 12% savings on this tier comes from.

Examples: "Design a distributed rate limiter", "Architect a real-time collaborative editor", "Implement a B+ tree with insert/delete"

### What got mis-classified

Two complex prompts scored as medium:
- "Implement a garbage collector in Python" - uses familiar keywords ("implement", "Python") without architectural framing
- "Write a compiler frontend for a simple expression language" - "simple" in the prompt text confused the classifier

Both are edge cases where the prompt sounds simpler than the task actually is. We're tuning the classifier to weigh task-type keywords more heavily.

## Raw cost comparison

| Tier | Baseline (all Sonnet) | Routed | Savings | How |
|------|----------------------|--------|---------|-----|
| Simple | $0.0209 | $0.0006 | 97.3% | Routed to Flash |
| Medium | $0.0212 | $0.0006 | 97.3% | Routed to Flash |
| Complex | $0.0978 | $0.0859 | 12.1% | Stayed on Sonnet + Context Optimize |
| **Total** | **$0.1399** | **$0.0871** | **37.7%** | **Routing + Context Optimize** |

## What this means

If you spend $5,000/month on LLM APIs and your prompt mix is roughly 1/3 simple, 1/3 medium, 1/3 complex, Nadir saves you around $1,900/month. Complex prompts stay on premium. You don't lose quality where it matters.`,

  "context-optimize-savings": `## The problem

Agentic coding sessions are expensive because of bloated context. Every turn in a conversation accumulates:
- Repeated tool schemas (the same function definitions sent every time)
- Pretty-printed JSON (indented with whitespace that costs tokens)
- Duplicate system prompts across turns
- Old conversation history that's no longer relevant

With Claude Opus at $15/1M input tokens, this adds up fast.

## What Context Optimize does

All transforms are lossless. Zero semantic degradation. The LLM receives the same information, just compacted:

| Transform | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| JSON minification | Removes whitespace, newlines from JSON values |
| Tool schema dedup | Replaces repeated tool definitions with references |
| System prompt dedup | Removes duplicated instructions across turns |
| Whitespace normalization | Collapses blanks, preserves code indentation |
| Chat history trimming | Keeps system + first + last N turns |

## Benchmark results (Claude Opus)

| Scenario | Before (tokens) | After | Saved | $/1K requests |
|----------|---------------:|------:|------:|---------------:|
| Agentic coding (8 turns, 5 tools) | 3,657 | 1,573 | 57.0% | $31.26 |
| RAG pipeline (6 chunks) | 544 | 386 | 29.0% | $2.37 |
| API response analysis (nested JSON) | 1,634 | 616 | 62.3% | $15.27 |
| Long debug session (50 turns) | 3,856 | 1,414 | 63.3% | $36.63 |
| OpenAPI spec context (5 endpoints) | 2,649 | 762 | 71.2% | $28.30 |
| **Total** | **12,340** | **4,751** | **61.5%** | **$113.84** |

The biggest wins come from agentic sessions with repeated tool schemas and long debug sessions with JSON logs.

## How to enable it

Context Optimize runs in safe mode by default. Add it to your API key config or enable it globally:

\`\`\`yaml
layers:
  optimize: safe  # lossless transforms only
\`\`\`

The aggressive mode (semantic dedup, embedding-based redundancy removal) is available on the Pro plan.`,

  "why-we-built-nadir": `## The $0.45 docstring

Last year I was using Claude Opus for a coding project. Great model. But then I looked at my API bill and noticed something: a significant chunk of my spend was on prompts like:

- "Write a docstring for this function"
- "What does HTTP 404 mean?"
- "Convert this to TypeScript"

These prompts were hitting Opus at $15/1M input tokens. They could have been handled by Haiku at $0.80/1M or Gemini Flash at $0.075/1M. Same quality output, 20-200x cheaper.

## The manual approach doesn't work

I tried switching models manually. The problem: you don't know the complexity of a prompt until you've read it. And in agentic workflows (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider), the model is called hundreds of times automatically. You can't manually pick the model for each call.

## What we built

Nadir sits between your app and the LLM providers. It classifies each prompt in ~50ms using a DistilBERT-based classifier, then routes to the cheapest model that can handle it:

- **Simple** (status checks, formatting, basic Q&A) - Gemini Flash / Haiku
- **Medium** (code generation, explanations) - GPT-4o-mini / Haiku
- **Complex** (architecture, debugging, reasoning) - stays on your premium model

The classifier runs locally. Your API keys never leave your machine. No third-party proxy.

## Why open source

We're MIT licensed because we think model routing should be infrastructure, not a service that can pull the plug on you. Self-host it, fork it, contribute to it. If you want a hosted version with extra features, that's what the Pro plan is for.`,

  "how-binary-classifier-works": `## Architecture overview

Nadir's binary classifier has three stages:

1. **Embedding** - DistilBERT encodes the prompt into a 384-dim vector (~10ms)
2. **Centroid matching** - Compare against learned centroids for simple/medium/complex (~1ms)
3. **Tier assignment** - Map complexity tier to model selection (~0ms)

Total: ~50-100ms classification overhead.

## Stage 1: Embedding

We use \`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\` to encode prompts. It runs locally on CPU, no GPU needed. The model is 22MB and loads in ~2 seconds on startup.

Why not a larger model? Because the embedding is just for classification, not generation. MiniLM-L6 captures enough semantic signal to distinguish "what is 2+2" from "design a distributed system" reliably.

## Stage 2: Centroid matching

During training, we compute centroid embeddings for each complexity tier from labeled examples. At inference time, we compute cosine similarity between the prompt embedding and each centroid.

The classifier outputs:
- **Tier probabilities:** e.g., simple=0.99, medium=0.003, complex=0.003
- **Confidence score:** 0.0 (simple) to 1.0 (complex)
- **Tier name:** simple / medium / complex

## Stage 3: Model selection

The tier maps to a model selection strategy:

| Tier | Strategy | Example models |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Simple (score < 0.2) | Cheapest available | Gemini Flash, GPT-3.5 |
| Medium (0.2 - 0.7) | Mid-tier | GPT-4o-mini, Haiku |
| Complex (score > 0.7) | Premium (benchmark model) | Sonnet, GPT-4o, Opus |

The ranker filters available models by the user's allowed list, then sorts by cost within the tier.

## Accuracy

On our 50-prompt benchmark: 96% accuracy. The two errors were complex prompts that used simple-sounding language. We're working on a heuristic layer that detects task-type keywords (implement, design, architect) to catch these edge cases.

## What's next

We're training a confidence-aware analyzer that escalates uncertain classifications to a secondary check. If the primary classifier scores between 0.3-0.7, it runs a lightweight keyword analysis before committing to a tier. This should push accuracy above 98%.`,

  "nadir-vs-always-premium": `## When Nadir helps most

**High volume, mixed complexity:** If you're making 1000+ API calls/day and many are simple lookups, formatting, or basic Q&A, routing saves the most. Typical savings: 30-40%.

**Agentic workflows:** Claude Code, Cursor, Aider - these tools make hundreds of calls per session. Many are simple (read file, check status). Routing + context optimization can cut costs 50%+.

**BYOK setups:** When you bring your own API keys, Nadir just routes. You pay provider prices directly with zero markup.

## When to stick with one model

**All-complex workloads:** If every prompt is a complex reasoning task (legal analysis, medical diagnosis), routing won't help. Everything stays on premium anyway.

**Latency-critical paths:** The 50-100ms classification overhead matters if you're in a real-time pipeline where every millisecond counts. For most use cases, this is negligible.

**Small volume:** If you're spending <$50/month on LLM APIs, the operational overhead of running Nadir isn't worth the savings.

## The math

| Monthly spend | Prompt mix | Savings | Net after Nadir fee |
|---------------|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| $500 | 60% simple, 30% medium, 10% complex | ~$180 | ~$135 |
| $2,000 | 40% simple, 40% medium, 20% complex | ~$640 | ~$480 |
| $10,000 | 30% simple, 40% medium, 30% complex | ~$2,800 | ~$2,100 |

## Bottom line

If your workload has a mix of simple and complex prompts, Nadir pays for itself from day one. If everything you do needs premium reasoning, save yourself the setup.`,
